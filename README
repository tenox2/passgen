Passgen - A password generation utility written entirely in BASH (Bourne Again Shell). One day I needed this for a customized adduser script. It can be used standalone or included as a bash function/procedure. This utility is featured (and further explained) in Advanced Bash Scripting Guide (HOWTO). Somebody asked me for a commercial KSH version. It's avaiable as well. Also recently needed a function in AWK that does the same. Included is AWK script.
